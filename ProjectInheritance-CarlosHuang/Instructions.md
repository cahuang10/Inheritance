**Project on Inheritance and polymorphism.**
================================ 
  * Create your own inheritance relationship linking at least 2 classes, and including client (Main.java) code to make and use instances of your objects. 

  * Your code should demonstrate your understanding of:
    1.  Constructors: Your classes should have multiple  constructors and you should demonstrate that you know how to use them. (Give an explanation in your google doc, 2 points)
    2. Methods: There should be methods at both the super and subclass levels. At least one method should be overridden(2 points). At least one method should be specific just to a particular subclass (2 points). 
    3. Polymorphism: Group a collection of objects of different types into a single array or ArrayList and then call a variety of methods on those objects.
    4. Downcasting: Take one item from your collection and demonstrate how to downcast to run a method otherwise off limits.
* Documentation: 
  In a google document demonstrate your understanding of:
    1. Superclasses and subclasses
    2. “is-a” vs. “has-a” relationships and how those relationships appear in code design
    3. What it means to override a method – explained in the context of your example
    4. Downcasting – what it is and under what circumstances it needs to happen.

**Please tag your code in comments. For instance, the superClass declaration should have a comment with #1 in it.**
